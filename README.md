# Python in practice

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts and projects that demonstrate various concepts and techniques in Python programming. The goal is to provide practical examples that can be used as references or starting points for your own projects.

<!-- Include implementing of differents library (mediapipe, openCV, matplot) -->
### Libraries Used
- `mediapipe`: A library for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines.
- `openCV`: A library for computer vision and image processing.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
- `numpy`: A library for the Python programming language that supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

### Content
- `Body pos-tracking`: A script that uses `mediapipe` to track body positions in real-time using a webcam.
- `Object detection`: A script that uses `openCV` to detect objects in images or video streams.
- `Gradient descent`: A script that implements the gradient descent algorithm for optimization problems.
